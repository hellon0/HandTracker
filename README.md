# HandTracker
Hand tracker made in python using mediapipe, opencv, and numpy.

I didn't do much to code what is currently done myself, but the end goal is to be able to train my own hand tracker using the data from the program that uses mediapipe, and use that new trained network to recognize certain hand gestures. My main idea for this is an ASL to text program, but I'm open to suggestions.
